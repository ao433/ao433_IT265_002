#### Goals for this Module
 Example Template include the brackets to make a checklist, fill them in as appropriate
- [ Complete my case study of the Atari 2600 game Wabbit. ] Goal 1
- [Understand more about the concept of playing with the game rather than against. ] Goal 2
- [ Take on a full fledged playthrough of Wabbit to have a better analysis of it for my case study. ] Goal 3


#### Progress
- **What I accomplished**:
  - Summarize completed tasks or progress made.
  - [I managed to complete my case study of Wabbit by combing through  ]

- **Challenges faced**:
  - Describe blockers, bugs, or issues encountered.
  - N/a

- **Solutions**:
  - Detail how you addressed challenges or your thought process.
  - N/a

#### Learnings
- Key insights, techniques, or concepts explored.
- [ I've learned that Atari 2600's TIA chip is resonsible for producing audio, video, and controller inputs all at the same time. I've also learned how deep and important intrasive elements can be for a game. For example, creating classes that have bane and boon attributes towards other neighboring classes renders a game in an area filled with unique trade offs which coule be considered fair. ]

#### Free Thinking
- Brainstorm or reflect on design ideas, architecture patterns, or potential improvements.
-  [ I wonder what would happen if a game were to forgo the laws of intrasive relationships and instead opt for making every class strong without any hindrances to speak of? Would any unbalance happen if every class is supposedly on the same level as each other? ]
-  [ Would my frustration playing Wabbit led to the game being a bad one or is the design choices like the egg throwing being slow and pedantic a intended decision from the game designer for the player to master. ]

- Example prompts:
  - "What if the player interactions were asynchronous instead of real-time?"
  - "How could ECS improve performance in this system?"
  - "Does my current design support scalability? How can it improve?"

#### Next Steps
- Tasks or experiments to focus on during the next session.
-  [ I look forward in the future case studies such as what constitutes as a bad game and the importance on color theory. ]
