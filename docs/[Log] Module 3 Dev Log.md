#### Goals for this Module
<!-- Example Template (include the brackets to make a checklist, fill them in as appropriate
- [ Come up with 3 games and find at least 2 flaws and solutions for each one in this week's assignemnt ]Goal 1
- [ Comtemplate more about what boad game I'll be developing soon ] Goal 2
- [ Understand how the concept of how important color theory is to a game ] Goal 3
-->

#### Progress
- **What I accomplished**:
  - Summarize completed tasks or progress made.
  - I managed to complete this week's assignment and even bypassed the necessary limit on what I have to write. This assignment is really representative to how much I enjoy the topic of videogames regradless of their quality. I also came up with a fine, simple concept for the game I'm going to create for the course.
- **Challenges faced**:
  - Describe blockers, bugs, or issues encountered.
  - It was rather difficult going out of my way to ponder about what bad games I've played and to be able to figure solutions to make their pre-existing mechanics better as I dont normally go out of my way to play garbage like that.
- **Solutions**:
  - Detail how you addressed challenges or your thought process.
  - I thought over what games I believe are bland or have gotten tired of recently for a theoretical analysis write-up and it made the assignment so much easier to commit to.

#### Learnings
- Key insights, techniques, or concepts explored.
- I appreciate the subtleties in color harmony by which aids video games to be these majestic and believable words to be apart. It's always why whenever you see game renowned for it's landscape design, it's something you come to expect and enjoy like Zelda's greeny fields mixed with blue rivers, gray rocks, and multicolored fauna or creatures roaming across the land.
#### Free Thinking
- Brainstorm or reflect on design ideas, architecture patterns, or potential improvements.
-  What would "subverting expectations" when dealing with color theory in a game look like?
- If games are held up to a standard for being these immersive simulators then is it possible to have games with the utmost minimalistic UI in all sorts of different genres and still be coherent enough for the player to complete?

- Example prompts:
  - "What if the player interactions were asynchronous instead of real-time?"
  - "How could ECS improve performance in this system?"
  - "Does my current design support scalability? How can it improve?"

#### Next Steps
- Tasks or experiments to focus on during the next session.
- I prepare myself to learn more about the concepts of color theory so I can apply those techniques to the game I recentlt did a case study on. I wonder what would change? Would my appropriate tastes make the game I've lambasted any good when painted in a different vision?
